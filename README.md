# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Features

### Home Page (Landing Page)

- Built a landing page for users to explore the application.
- Additional features like "Explore" and "Try It Out" can be added in the future.

### Models Page

- Developed a models page where data is fetched from a JSON placeholder.
- Utilized dummy data from the JSON placeholder API to populate cards.
- Combined data from two different API endpoints to populate the cards accordingly.
- Implemented a filter for cards based on the `albumID` attribute and whether the cards are featured.
- Currently, a random function is used to designate some cards as featured. However, with a user database, this could be further refined based on user interactions, such as likes.
